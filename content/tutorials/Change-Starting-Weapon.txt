# Change Starting Weapon

### Open your mapname.gsc and find the following line:

// zm_usermap::main();

### Anywhere underneath that but still within function main(), insert these lines:
/*
level.start_weapon = GetWeapon( "pistol_standard" ); // CHANGE THIS FOR STARTING PISTOL
level.default_laststandpistol = GetWeapon( "pistol_standard" );	// CHANGE THIS FOR LAST STAND PISTOL IN COOP
level.default_solo_laststandpistol = GetWeapon( "pistol_standard_upgraded" ); // CHANGE THIS FOR LAST STAND PISTOL IN SOLO
level.laststandpistol = level.default_laststandpistol;
*/

### You can now change these lines to your liking. I've included comments to make it easier to understand what each line does.


## That's all, Happy Modding!
