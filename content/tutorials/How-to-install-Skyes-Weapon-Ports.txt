# How to install TheSkyeLord's Weapon Ports
 
### First, download any of TheSkyeLord's weapon ports (you can find them on UGXMods or Devraw).

### Next, extract all the folders from the zip file into your Black ops 3 root folder.

### Then, open your maps zone file and add the following line:

// include,type_your_zpkg_name_here

### Now, open your map folder, and open the zone_source folder.

### Inside that folder, you will make a new file named type_your_zpkg_name_here.zpkg

### Now, you will return back to the zip file, and open [ADD TO .ZONE FILE.txt], open it, and copy the contents of the file.

### Paste the contents into the new zpkg file you made.



## That's all, Happy Modding!
