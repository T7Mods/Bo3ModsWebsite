# Change starting points amount
 
### Open your mapname.gsc and find the following line:

// zm_usermap::main();

### Anywhere underneath that, but still within function main(), insert the following line:

// level.player_starting_points = 500000;

### You can change 500000 to any amount of starting points you want the player to have.

## That's all, Happy Modding!
